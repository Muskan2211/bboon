<li>Tech giants look for the candidates who generally are excellent in algorithm designing and coding. You can surely not skip data structures and algorithms if you are looking to prepare for companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, etc.</li>

<li>Revise the working and use of popular Data Structures: Apart from set 1, more data structures to be focused are:</li>
<ul>
<li>Heap</li>
<li>Hashing</li>
<li>Advanced Data Structures</li>
<li>Trees and Graphs</li>
</ul>
