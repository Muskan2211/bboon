<ul  style="list-style-type:disc">
<li><p>The word robot comes from the Czech robota. In English, robota translates to "forced labor."</p></li>
<li><p> A red panda is native to the Himalayas and southwestern China. Translated, the English word for red panda is "Firefox," which is where the browser gets its name.</p></li>
<li><p> In 2012, at least 17 newborn girls were named Siri.</p></li>
<li><p>There are more than 682 million iPhone across the globe.</p></li>
<li><p>Created in 1956, the first ever VCR was the size of a piano.</p></li>
<li><p>The world's first camera took eight hours to snap a photo.</p></li>
<li><p>The very first Apple logo featured Sir Isaac Newton sitting underneath a tree, with an apple about to hit his head.</p></li>
<li><p>Alaska is the only state in America that can be typed on one row of a traditional English QWERTY keyboard.</p></li>
<li><p>About 1 out of 8 married couples actually met each other on the Internet</p></li>
<li><p>Tech companies often test new products in New Zealand. The reasons for this? The country is diverse, its residents speak English, and if a product is a flop, news doesn't spread as fast because it is relatively isolated.</p></li>
<li><p> In 2012, NYU-Poly constructed a robotic fish and placed it in a tank of golden shiners. The robot simulated the fishes' motions so well, it was eventually accepted and became their leader.
</p></li>
<li><p>Bill Gates's house was designed a Mac.</p></li>
<li><p>The first alarm clock could only ring at one time of day, four o'clock in the morning.</p></li>
<li><p>When the first iPod prototype was shown to Steve Jobs, he dropped it in an aquarium. No, it wasn't just a klutzy move: Jobs used the subsequent air bubbles to prove there was empty space and it could be made smaller.</p></li>
<li><p>Phantom Vibration Syndrome is the name given when someone thinks their phone is vibrating but is not.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a factory in Japan which can run unsupervised for 30 days at a time -- it's almost entirely manned by robots.</p></li>
<li><p>In Mexico City, there are special bins that offer free wifi to people who properly dispose of their dog poop.</p></li>
<li><p> There used to be fake Apple stores in China. They were so fake, in fact, that even the staff were convinced they were working for Apple.</p></li>
<li><p>Carrier pigeons beat internet upload speed as late as in 2010. They actually sent pigeons over with USB sticks the same time they started uploading a video over broadband. The pigeons won.</p></li>
